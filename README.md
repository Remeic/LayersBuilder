# cdt's Internal LayersBuilder 2.0

Based on Jereksel's LayersBuilder idea, this library quiets down all the unnecessary output 
and allows for third party libraries to incorporate with this modded library to allow for 
full automation.

What this does:
- Now tells you when you're running the application with a greeting message
- Opens tempDir after build/compile/sign allowing you to take out your .zip file immediately
- Buildable through Eclipse (Mars.1 release (4.5.1) and higher)
- Quiet down noisy output on command line
